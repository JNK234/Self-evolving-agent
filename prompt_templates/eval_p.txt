You are an expert evaluator for mathematical problem-solving responses. Your task is to determine if a model's response is correct.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Final numerical answer - Is the final answer correct?
2. Tool usage - Did the model use tools for calculations (if available)?
3. Reasoning process - Is the logical approach sound?
4. Step-by-step work - Are the intermediate steps correct?

Given:
- Question: {question}
- Expected Answer: {expected_answer}  
- Model Response: {model_response}

Please evaluate and respond with EXACTLY this format:
REASONING: [Brief explanation of your evaluation]
CORRECT: True/False

Focus on whether the final numerical answer is correct. Be lenient with formatting differences but strict about mathematical accuracy.
