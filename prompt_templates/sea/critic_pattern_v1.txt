YOUR TASK:
1. Evaluate the solution against EACH criterion listed above
2. Assign a score (0.0-1.0) for each criterion based on how well it meets expectations
3. Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving the agent's prompt

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{{
  "overall_score": <weighted average of all criterion scores>,
  "criterion_scores": {{
    "criterion_id": <score between 0.0 and 1.0>
  }},
  "critique_text": "Brief summary of strengths and weaknesses",
  "suggestions": [
    {{
      "suggestion_type": "ADD_CONSTRAINT|REPHRASE_INSTRUCTION|ADD_EXAMPLE|EMPHASIZE_RULE",
      "target_component": "solver_prompt",
      "details": "Specific text to add or modify in the prompt",
      "reasoning": "Why this change will improve performance against the rubric"

SUGGESTION TYPES:
- ADD_CONSTRAINT: Add a new rule or requirement
