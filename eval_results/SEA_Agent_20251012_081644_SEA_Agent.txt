Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Expected Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
To calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we need to find out how many clips she sold in May and then add that to the number of clips sold in April.

First, we calculate the number of clips sold in May, which is half of what was sold in April. Natalia sold 48 clips in April, so in May she sold \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) clips.

Now, we add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May to get the total number of clips sold in both months.

April: 48 clips
May: \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \) clips

Total: \( 48 + 24 = 72 \) clips

Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
To calculate Weng's earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting at a rate of $12 per hour, we need to first convert the hours to minutes, then apply the hourly rate to the calculated time in minutes. Here's how I would call the functions to perform this calculation:

1. Convert 50 minutes to hours: 50 minutes is 50/60 hours.
2. Multiply the hourly rate by the time worked in hours to get the earnings.

The sequence of function calls to achieve this would be:

```
[
  {"name": "divide", "arguments": {"numerator": 50, "denominator": 60}},
  {"name": "multiply", "arguments": {"a": 12, "b": "result of previous call (divide function)"}}
]
```

However, since I can't actually call these functions, I will provide the calculation steps:

1. Convert minutes to hours: 50 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.8333 hours
2. Calculate earnings: 0.8333 hours × $12/hour ≈ $10

Weng earned about $10.
