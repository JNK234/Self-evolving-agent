Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
To convert the point $(0,3)$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to calculate the radius $r$ and the angle $\theta$.

The radius $r$ is given by the distance from the origin to the point, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem since the x-coordinate is 0. Thus, $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3$.

The angle $\theta$ is the angle formed with the positive x-axis. Since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (or 90 degrees).

Therefore, the polar coordinates are $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$.

Here are the function calls to calculate $r$ and $\theta$ in the required format:

```json
[
    {"name": "sqrt", "arguments": {"x": 0, "y": 3.0}},
    {"name": "power", "arguments": {"base": 1, "exponent": 3.0}}
]
```

The `sqrt` function calculates the radius, and the `power` function is not necessary for this calculation. The angle is known from the geometry of the point.

Example 2:
Question: Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
Expected Answer: p - q

Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
To express the double sum in terms of $p$ and $q$, we can use the given definitions of $p$ and $q$:

\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]

However, the double sum:

\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]

is not directly related to $p$ or $q$ because $p$ and $q$ are both infinite series with respect to the second summation index, whereas the double sum iterates $j$ first, then $k$. The inner sum $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ does not correspond to either $p$ or $q$ as they are defined.

The series $p$ and $q$ are Lovelace-type series (also known as the Apéry's zeta function) evaluated at 2 and 3, respectively, and they do not directly relate to the sum of reciprocals of cubes of the sum of indices.

Therefore, it is not possible to express the given double sum in terms of $p$ and $q$ using the information provided and the standard mathematical transformations. Each of the series $p$ and $q$ is well-defined and known to converge to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and $\zeta(3)$, respectively, where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function, but they do not interact with the double sum in a straightforward manner.

In conclusion, the double sum cannot be written in terms of $p$ and $q$ with the given definitions.
