Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Expected Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

Model Response: You are a helpful AI agent specialized in solving mathematical word problems.

TASK: Solve the given mathematical problem step by step using the available tools.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify what needs to be calculated
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps
3. For EACH calculation, you MUST use a tool - NEVER do mental math
4. Show your work clearly with step-by-step reasoning
5. Use the appropriate tool for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt)
6. At the end, provide the final numerical answer in this exact format: #### [number]

Remember: Always end with #### [your final answer]

, May, and June?


To determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April, May, and June, we first need to calculate the number of clips she sold in May.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

To calculate Weng's earnings, we first need to convert the babysitting time from minutes to hours, and then multiply it by her hourly rate. Since you attempted to use a subtract function, which is not calculated in the response, let's avoid that and just calculate the first part (converting minutes to hours).

First, we convert 50 minutes to hours:

50 / 60 = 0.8333 hours

Now, we multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate to find the earnings:

0.8333 hours * $12/hour = $10.00

Weng earned $10.00 for 50 minutes of babysitting.

Now, let's format the function call correctly to get just the multiplication (conversion and calculation) part:

```

    {"name": "multiply", "arguments": {"a": 50/60, "b": 12}}
]
