Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
To calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we first need to find out how many clips she sold in May, which is half of what she sold in April. Then we can add that to the April sales to get the total.

First, let's find out how many clips she sold in May:
1. April sales: 48 clips
2. May sales: half of April sales = 48 / 2 = 24 clips

Now, let's add the sales from April and May to get the total:
3. Total sales: April sales (48) + May sales (24) = 48 + 24 = 72 clips

Natalia sold a total of 72 clips altogether in April and May.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

Yes, that's correct. If Weng earns $12 an hour and she worked for 50 minutes, her earnings would be half an hour. Multiplying $12 by 0.5 (half an hour) equals $6. Weng earned $6 for the 50 minutes of babysitting she did yesterday.
