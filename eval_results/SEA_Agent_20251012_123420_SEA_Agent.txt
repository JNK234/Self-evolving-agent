Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
To convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ), we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the radius \( r \) using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

2. Calculate the angle \( \theta \) using the arctangent function:
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]
   Note: We may need to adjust \( \theta \) based on the quadrant in which the point lies.

For the point (0, 3), we have:
- \( x = 0 \)
- \( y = 3 \)

Let's first calculate the radius \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate the angle \( \theta \):
Since \( x = 0 \), we are on the positive y-axis, so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or 90 degrees).

The polar coordinates are therefore:
\[ (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2}) \]

The JSON response with the single function call to calculate the polar coordinates would be:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "convertRectToPolar",
        "arguments": {
            "x": 0,
            "y": 3
        }
    }
]
```
However, since we don't have an exact function named "convertRectToPolar" provided, we will perform the calculation directly:

```json
[
    {"name": "sqrt", "arguments": {"x": "0", "y": "3"}},
    {"name": "arctan", "arguments": {"y": "3", "x": "0"}}
]
```

But since we can only call one function at a time, we will first calculate the radius \( r \) and then determine \( \theta \) accordingly:

```json
[
    {"name": "sqrt", "arguments": {"x": 0, "y": 3}}
]
```

After obtaining the radius \( r \), we can manually determine \( \theta \) to be \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) because the point lies on the positive y-axis. Thus, the final answer in polar coordinates is \( (3, \frac{\pi}{2}) \).

Example 2:
Question: Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
Expected Answer: p - q

Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
To express \(\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), we need to first understand that \(p\) and \(q\) are given by an infinite series where the terms involve squares and cubes of natural numbers respectively. However, the series given for \(p\) and \(q\) do not directly translate to the double sum of the series we are given.

The series for \(p\) and \(q\) are related to the Riemann zeta function at 2 and 3 respectively, often denoted as \(\zeta(2)\) and \(\zeta(3)\). Specifically, we have:
\[p = \zeta(2) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\]
\[q = \zeta(3) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}\]

The series we are interested in, however, involves a sum over the reciprocals of the cubes of sums of natural numbers. There is no direct relation between this series and the series for \(\zeta(2)\) and \(\zeta(3)\), and thus, it cannot be expressed in terms of \(p\) and \(q\) using a simple algebraic manipulation or a known function of \(p\) and \(q\).

Therefore, it appears that the task as stated cannot be completed using the information provided about \(p\) and \(q\). The series \(\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\) does not seem to be directly related to the series \(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\) and \(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}\). Additional mathematical tools or insights would be required to find a relationship between these series, if one exists.

Given this, there is no function call for external information that can simplify or relate the series in question to \(p\) and \(q\). The response is based on internal knowledge about infinite series and the properties of the Riemann zeta function.
