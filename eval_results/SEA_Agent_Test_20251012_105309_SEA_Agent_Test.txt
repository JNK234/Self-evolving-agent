Example 1:
Question: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
Expected Answer: The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
To calculate the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum them up.

- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than twice the first friend's count.
- The third friend pressed 10 times more than four times the fourth friend's count.
- The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Let's break it down:

Second friend's rings = 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 20 * (5/4) = 25 rings
Third friend's rings = 4 * 60 + 10 = 240 + 10 = 250 rings

Now, we add them all up:
Total doorbell rings = 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 250 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend)

Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 250 + 60 = 355

So, the total number of doorbell rings made is 355.

Example 2:
Question: Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
Expected Answer: Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.
After Monday, he had a remainder of 39 - 15 = <<39-15=24>>24 pages to read.
To complete his reading, he must read 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pages a day.

Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
To calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we need to first find out the total number of pages he needs to read and then divide that by the number of days he has left to complete the reading.

First, let's add up the total number of pages from all the textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days = 24 / 4 = 6 pages/day

Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day to complete his reading.

Now, let's generate the JSON list with the function calls to calculate this:

```json
[
    {"functools":{"name":"subtract","arguments":{"a":39,"b":15}}},
    {"functools":{"name":"divide","arguments":{"a":24,"b":4}}}
]
```
