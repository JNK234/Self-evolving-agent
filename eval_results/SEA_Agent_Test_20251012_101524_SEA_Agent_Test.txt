Example 1:
Question: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
Expected Answer: The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
To calculate the total number of doorbell rings, we need to first find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell, and then sum those numbers.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed it 1/4 * 20 = 5 times more.

So the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now we can sum the doorbell rings from all friends:

First friend: 20 times
Second friend: 25 times
Third friend: 70 times
Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times

The doorbell made 175 rings.

Example 2:
Question: Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
Expected Answer: Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.
After Monday, he had a remainder of 39 - 15 = <<39-15=24>>24 pages to read.
To complete his reading, he must read 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pages a day.

Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
To calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read and then find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we can first add up the number of pages from each subject and then subtract the pages he has already read. After that, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

Science: 4 pages
Social Studies: 20 pages
History: 7 pages
Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Now, let's subtract the pages he has already read:

Pages left = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Pages left = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to read these pages, so we divide the pages left by the number of days to find the average:

Pages per day = Pages left / Number of days
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read on average 6 pages per day to finish his reading in the 4 days he has left.

The function calls to perform this calculation would be:

```json
[
    {"name": "add", "arguments": {"a": 4, "b": 20}},
    {"name": "add", "arguments": {"a": 7, "b": 8}},
    {"name": "subtract", "arguments": {"a": 39, "b": 15}},
    {"name": "divide", "arguments": {"a": 24, "b": 4}}
]
```
