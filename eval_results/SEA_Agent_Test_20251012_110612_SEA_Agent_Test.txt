Example 1:
Question: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
Expected Answer: The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
To calculate the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell and then add them together.

1. Jerome's first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. Jerome's second friend pressed 1/4 times more, which is 1/4 * 20 = 5 times, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add all the doorbell rings together:
- Jerome's first friend: 20 times
- Jerome's second friend: 25 times
- Jerome's third friend: 70 times
- Jerome's fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times

Jerome had 4 friends, so the doorbell rings a total of 175 times.

Example 2:
Question: Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
Expected Answer: Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.
After Monday, he had a remainder of 39 - 15 = <<39-15=24>>24 pages to read.
To complete his reading, he must read 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pages a day.

If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
To calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we first add up the pages from each textbook:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages already read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days = 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day

Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages in one day to complete the remaining reading in 4 days.
