Example 1:
Question: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Expected Answer: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
Model Response: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Janet eats 3 eggs per day and bakes 4 muffins (for her friends), but muffins are not an egg-related count, so we only consider eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market is:

16 eggs laid - 3 eggs eaten by Janet = 13 eggs

Each egg is sold for $2 at the farmers' market:

13 eggs * $2 per egg = $26

Thus, Janet makes $26 every day at the farmers' market.

Example 2:
Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
Expected Answer: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
Model Response: To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber used.

Given:
- Blue fiber required = 2 bolts
- White fiber required = half of the blue fiber required

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
White fiber = 1/2 * blue fiber = 1/2 * 2 = 1 bolt

Now, add the blue and white bolt quantities together:
Total bolts = blue fiber + white fiber = 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts required is #### 3.
Extracted Answer: 3.
Expected Answer: 3
Correct: No
