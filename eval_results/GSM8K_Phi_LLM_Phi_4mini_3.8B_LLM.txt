Example 1:
Question: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?
Expected Answer: The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.
#### 175
Model Response: First, we need to determine how many times the second friend pressed on the doorbell. The problem states that the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. Jerome's first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

\[
20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5
\]

Adding this to the number of times Jerome's first friend pressed on the doorbell:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 25 times.

Next, we need to determine how many times the third friend pressed on the doorbell. The problem states that the third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

\[
60 + 10 = 70
\]

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 70 times.

Finally, we sum up the total number of doorbell rings:

\[
20 \, (\text{first friend}) + 25 \, (\text{second friend}) + 70 \, (\text{third friend}) + 60 \, (\text{fourth friend})
= 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
= 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is #### 175.
Extracted Answer: 175.

Example 2:
Question: Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
Expected Answer: Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.
After Monday, he had a remainder of 39 - 15 = <<39-15=24>>24 pages to read.
To complete his reading, he must read 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pages a day.
#### 6
Model Response: Solo has to read a total of 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages.

He has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.

If Solo has 4 more days to read these 24 pages, then he needs to read on average 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.
Extracted Answer: .
Expected Answer: 6
