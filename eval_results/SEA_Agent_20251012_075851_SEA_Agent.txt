Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Expected Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.
#### 72

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
To calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we need to add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May. Since she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, we first need to find out how many clips were sold in May.

Let's start by calculating the number of clips sold in May:

Number of clips sold in May = 48 / 2
                           = 24

Now we can add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total:

Number of clips sold in April = 48
Number of clips sold in May = 24

Total number of clips sold = 48 + 24
                           = 72

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May combined.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
To calculate Weng's earnings for the 50 minutes of babysitting, we need to convert the minutes to hours and then multiply by her hourly rate.

First, we convert 50 minutes to hours:
50 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.8333 hours (repeating)

Then, we multiply the hourly rate by the hours worked:
$12.00 per hour * 0.8333 hours = $10.00 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Weng earned $10 from babysitting for 50 minutes yesterday. No function call is needed in this case as the computation is straightforward and can be done mentally or with basic arithmetic.
