Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Expected Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
To calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we first need to find out how many clips she sold in May. Since she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, we can use the divide function to divide the number of clips sold in April by 2.

First, we'll divide the number of clips sold in April (48) by 2 to get the number of clips sold in May.

```json
[{"name": "divide", "arguments": {"a": 48.0, "b": 2.0}}]
```

After executing the above function call, we would get the result for the number of clips sold in May. Then, we can add this result to the number of clips sold in April to get the total number of clips sold throughout both months.

However, since I can't execute the function call, I'll calculate the number of clips sold in May based on the given information:

48 clips in April / 2 = 24 clips in May

Now, we can add the number of clips sold in April and May to get the total:

48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips

So, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May altogether.

Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.
