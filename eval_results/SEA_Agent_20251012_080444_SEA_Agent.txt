Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Expected Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

I see now that we need to calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May. She sold 48 clips in April and half as many in May, which is 24 clips. To find the total, we add these two numbers together.

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Expected Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
To calculate Weng's earnings for the babysitting she did yesterday, we can use the divide function to find out how much she earns per minute and then multiply that by the total minutes she worked.

First, we'll convert 50 minutes to a decimal fraction of an hour by dividing by 60.

Then, we'll multiply the result by Weng's hourly rate of $12.

Here's how we can express these step functions in JSON format:

```json
[
    functraces[{"name": "divide","arguments": {"a": 50, "b": 60}}],
    functraces[{"name": multiply,"arguments": {"a": 1.0, "b": 12}}],
    functraces[{"name": "multiply,"arguments": {"a": [result of first function call], "b": 12}}]
]
```

However, we are not supposed to use the divide function directly, nor the multiply function directly, as it requires the result of the first function call. Instead, we will use the add function to calculate the earnings for 50 minutes, given that the hourly rate and total minutes are provided separately.

Here's the JSON list with the correct function calls:

```json
[
    functraces[{"name": add,"arguments": {"a": 12, "b": 50 / 60 * 12}}]
]
```

This will calculate Weng's earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting.
