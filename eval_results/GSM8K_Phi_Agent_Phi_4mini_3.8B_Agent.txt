Example 1:
Question: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Expected Answer: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
Model Response: To calculate how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day: 16 eggs.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking muffins: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold at the market by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg.

Now, let's perform the calculations:

3. Number of eggs left after Janet eats for breakfast and bakes muffins: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.
4. Money made from selling eggs at the farmers' market: 9 * $2 = $18.

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling her ducks' eggs.

Example 2:
Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
Expected Answer: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
Model Response: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response. The correct calculation should be as follows:

First, we find out how much white fiber is needed by taking half the amount of blue fiber. Since 1 bolt of blue fiber requires 2 bolts, 1/2 of that amount would be:

1 bolt blue fiber / 2 = 0.5 bolts white fiber

Now, to find the total number of bolts needed, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together:

2 bolts blue fiber + 0.5 bolts white fiber = 2.5 bolts in total

So, the robe takes a total of 2.5 bolts of fiber.
