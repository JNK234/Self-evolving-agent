Example 1:
Question: A hexagon is inscribed in a circle: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
[/asy] What is the measure of $\alpha$, in degrees?
Expected Answer: 145^\circ
Model Response: To find the measure of $\alpha$, we need to consider the properties of a hexagon inscribed in a circle. A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all angles equal, and each central angle corresponding to the arcs between the vertices of the hexagon measures 60 degrees, because the sum of the central angles must be 360 degrees, and a hexagon has six equal arcs.

In the given diagram, instead of a regular hexagon, we have angle labels at vertices B and F. Without loss of generality, let's assume the hexagon is not regular, as the angles at B and F are different.

The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is given by the formula:
$$(n-2) \times 180^\circ$$
where $n$ is the number of sides. For a hexagon, $n = 6$, so the sum of the interior angles is:
$$(6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ$$

We know two of the interior angles: one at vertex B and one at vertex F. If we assume the other four angles are all equal to $\alpha$, then we can express the sum of the interior angles as:
$$\alpha + \alpha + \alpha + \alpha + 110^\circ + 105^\circ = 720^\circ$$
$$4\alpha + 215^\circ = 720^\circ$$
$$4\alpha = 720^\circ - 215^\circ$$
$$4\alpha = 505^\circ$$
$$\alpha = \frac{505^\circ}{4}$$
$$\alpha = 126.25^\circ$$

Therefore, the measure of $\alpha$ is $126.25$ degrees.

Example 2:
Question: The equation
\[x^{10}+(13x-1)^{10}=0\,\]has 10 complex roots $r_1,$ $\overline{r}_1,$ $r_2,$ $\overline{r}_2,$ $r_3,$ $\overline{r}_3,$ $r_4,$ $\overline{r}_4,$ $r_5,$ $\overline{r}_5,$ where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Find the value of
\[\frac 1{r_1\overline{r}_1}+\frac 1{r_2\overline{r}_2}+\frac 1{r_3\overline{r}_3}+\frac 1{r_4\overline{r}_4}+\frac 1{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]
Expected Answer: 850
Model Response: To solve the given equation for complex roots and subsequently find the value of the expression involving the reciprocal of the products of each pair of complex conjugate roots, we need to invoke a mathematical function capable of finding the roots of a polynomial.

The provided functions do not include a specific function for finding the roots of polynomials. However, we can use a general principle of complex numbers and polynomials to derive the answer. The product of a complex number and its conjugate is equal to the square of its magnitude, which is a real number. Since the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, the product of each pair of conjugate roots will be the square of their magnitude, which is a positive real number. Therefore, the reciprocal of each product will be a positive real number as well.

For a complex number \( a + bi \) and its conjugate \( a - bi \), their product is \( (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2 \), which is real. The reciprocal of this product is \( \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} \). Since the roots come in pairs of conjugates, the sum of the reciprocals will be the sum of these positive real numbers.

However, without a function to explicitly find the roots, we cannot proceed to calculate the exact value. If we had a function that could find and return the roots of the polynomial, we could then use the above principle to calculate the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each pair of complex conjugate roots.

Since we cannot call an external function to find the roots, we can only provide the conceptual approach to solving the problem. If you need the exact numerical answer, you would need a computational tool or software capable of handling polynomial root finding and complex numbers.

Here is a representation of the conceptual approach without an actual computational function call:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": "roots_of_polynomial"
}
```

Please note that "roots_of_polynomial" is not an actual function available in the provided list, but it is used here to illustrate the concept. To solve the problem with precision, you would need to use appropriate mathematical software or a function that is not listed here.
