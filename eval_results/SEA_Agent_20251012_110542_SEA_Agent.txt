Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
To calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold, we need to add the number of clips sold in April to half the number sold in May.

First, let's calculate the number of clips sold in May:
Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24

Now, let's add the number of clips sold in April (48) to the number sold in May (24):
48 + 24 = 72

Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.
